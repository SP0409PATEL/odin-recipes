        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Torta Caprese is a classic Italian chocolate and almond cake
            originating from the island of Capri. It's rich, dense, and
            naturally gluten-free, made with ground almonds and dark chocolate.
            This indulgent dessert is loved for its fudgy texture and intense
            flavors.

            <li>1 1/2 cup almond flour</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack set in the
                middle. Butter a round 9-inch springform pan and cover bottom
                with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a double boiler, melt the butter and bittersweet chocolate,
                stirring occasionally to blend. Keep an eye on it and turn off
                the heat as soon as it's all melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the jar of a blender, place the eggs and sweetened condensed
                milk. Puree until smooth. Incorporate the melted chocolate and
                puree again. Then add the almond flour, baking soda, baki
                powder, salt, and puree again. Lastly add the boiling water and
                puree again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 40
                minutes, until top is fluffy and springy to the touch, and a
                toothpick comes out moist but not wet.
            </li>
        </ol>
